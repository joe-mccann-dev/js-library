# README

The primary purpose of this repo is to practice using JS constructor functions. See: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library

Update 10/14/2022: As I've learned about JavaScript `class` syntax, I've replaced the constructor function with the `class` syntax and defined `toggleRead()` within the class.
